# How to Download RealTracks Sets for Band-in-a-Box
 
RealTracks are real audio recordings of musicians playing various instruments that can be used to create realistic backing tracks for your songs. RealTracks replace the MIDI track for that instrument, and can be controlled just like the MIDI instrument (volume changes, muting etc.). They follow the chord progression that you have entered, so you hear an authentic audio accompaniment or solo.
