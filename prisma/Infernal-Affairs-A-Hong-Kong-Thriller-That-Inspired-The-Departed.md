The sequels also feature new characters played by notable actors such as Carina Lau, Francis Ng, Leon Lai and Chen Daoming.

However, many fans and critics prefer the original for its authenticity, subtlety and cultural nuances. If you are a fan of Hong Kong cinema or crime thrillers, you should not miss Infernal Affairs.
